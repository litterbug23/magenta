# mx_process_create

## NAME

process_create - create a new process

## SYNOPSIS

```
#include <magenta/syscalls.h>

mx_status_t mx_process_create(mx_handle_t job,
                              const char* name, uint32_t name_len,
                              uint32_t flags,
                              mx_handle_t* proc_handle, mx_handle_t* vmar_handle);

```

## DESCRIPTION

**process_create**() creates a new process.

Upon success a handle for the new process and the root of its address space
is returned.  The thread will not start executing until *process_start()* is
called.

When the last handle to a process is closed, the process is destroyed.

Process handles may be waited on and will assert the signal
*MX_SIGNAL_SIGNALED* when the process exits.

## RETURN VALUE

**process_create**() returns NO_ERROR, a handle to the new process
(via *proc_handle*), and a handle to the root of its address space (via
*vmar_handle*) on success.  In the event of failure, a negative error value
is returned.

## ERRORS

**ERR_INVALID_ARGS**  *name* was an invalid pointer, or *name_len*
was greater than *MX_MAX_NAME_LEN*, or *flags* was non-zero.

**ERR_NO_MEMORY**  (Temporary) Failure due to lack of memory.
